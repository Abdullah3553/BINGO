# Welcome to BINGO :D 
First, dont forget to make CMakeLists.txt file.
Use the templete we made before to connect SFML 
libraryies with Clion.In other words, copy any 
CMakeLists.txt you have made before and paste it
in the project. Dont forget to reload the project.
Also, dont forget to add the external header files 
to CMakeLists.txt.
Good Luck :)   .
