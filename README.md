# Welcome to BINGO :D 

If u r working on Clion, Dont forget to create CMakeLists.txt file. 
use the templete we made before to import SFML to the project.
in other words, use any old CMakeLists.txt file to import sfml libiraries.
Also, dont forget to edit The project name in CMakeLists.txt . 
Good luck in Work :)
